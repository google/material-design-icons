# Material design icons

Material design icons are the official [icon set](http://www.google.com/design/spec/style/icons.html#icons-system-icons) from Google that are designed under the [material design guidelines](http://www.google.com/design/spec).

### 2.2 Update

41 new icons!

Check out what's new in the [material icons library](https://www.google.com/design/icons/).

## Getting Started

Read the [developer guide](http://google.github.io/material-design-icons/) on how to use the material design icons in your project.

### Using a font collection

The `iconfont` folder contains pre-generated font files that can be included in a project. This is especially convenient for the web; however, it is generally better to link to the web font hosted on Google Fonts:

```html
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/icon?family=Material+Icons"
      rel="stylesheet">
```

Read more in the [font portion](http://google.github.io/material-design-icons/#icon-font-for-the-web) of our full developer guide.

### Using symbols and sprites

The `css-sprite` and `svg-sprite` folders contain pre-generated sprite sheets, as well as svg symbols that can be `<use>`d more directly and with fewer constraints. Instructions for using them are in the [sprites documentation](https://github.com/google/material-design-icons/tree/master/sprites).

## Polymer icons

If you wish to use the icon set with Polymer, we recommend consuming them via the [`<iron-icons>`](https://github.com/polymerelements/iron-icons) element ([`<core-icons>`](https://github.com/Polymer/core-icons) in v0.5).

## License

We have made these icons available for you to incorporate them into your products under the [Creative Common Attribution 4.0 International License (CC-BY 4.0)](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). Feel free to remix and re-share these icons and documentation in your products.
We'd love attribution in your app's *about* screen, but it's not required.
The only thing we ask is that you not re-sell the icons themselves.
